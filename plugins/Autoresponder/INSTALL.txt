To install the Autoresponder plugin:

1. Unpackage into your phplist plugins dir as you would with any plugin

2. Ensure that the .htaccess file included with the plugin package exists--this will allow you to call the process.php
   script from cron. If you're not using apache, you will need to allow execution of process.php.
  
3. Visit the autoresponder section in phplist admin. Click on the Process Autoresponders button to determine what URL to
   setup in cron.
   
4. Copy the URL from #3 and setup a cron process to call the URL at regular intervals. For example:
   wget -O - -q -t 1 http://yourphplistdomain.com/admin/plugins/Autoresponder/process.php?key=your_key
   
   The process.php file is responsible for preparing the message queue ahead of phplist's regular old processqueue. Once
   Autoresponder's process.php runs, the messages will start sending the next time processqueue runs.
   
5. Add some draft messages to use as Autoresponders. The Autoresponder plugin uses draft messages as the message that are
   sent as an autoresponder. Be sure that you select some lists in your draft message--new members of the lists you selected
   will get the autoresponder message.

6. Create an autoresponder in the phplist admin section. For each autoresponder created you will get a new user attribute. That
   user attribute will be populated with the date the message was sent to the user. If the attribute is empty, the message has
   not been sent.
