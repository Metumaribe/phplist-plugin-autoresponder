DESCRIPTION
--------------------------

The Autoresponder plugin allows one to send newsletters to users of a list based on the
time elapsed since that user joined the list (a different actual time for each user). For example,
if one wanted to send a newsletter to every user 1 hour after joining a particular list, the autoresponder
plugin provides that ability.

REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------

phplist 2.10.18+ (tested on 2.10.18)

The script mostly assumes a relative plugin directory within admin. For example 'admin/plugins/'--this is the default, so
if you're using the default you should be fine.

Due to phplist's rather poor and fragile plugin architecture your mileage _will_ vary.
